WCET (worst case execution time) analysis:

utilization factor of one frame = execution time * frequency = execution time / Period
CPU Load = summation of utilization factor for all tasks

Door state message will be sent by ECU_1 every 10ms to ECU_2.
Light switch state message will be sent by ECU_1 every 20ms to ECU_2.
Speed state message will be sent by ECU_1 every 5ms to ECU_2.

In ECU 1, assuming tasks required to periodicaly send CAN status frames are identical
& also assuming to have an execution time of (1 ms).

CPU Load for ECU 1 = ( 1 / 10 ) + ( 1 / 20 ) + ( 1 / 5 ) = 0.35 = 35 %

ECU_2 has a periodic task to call the "VIO_Main" API to evaluate sensor values and operate warnings accordingly.
This task is called every (5 ms)

In ECU 2, assuming tasks required to periodicaly receive CAN status frames are identical
& also assuming to have an execution time of (1 ms).

And Assuming the task, required to call the "VIO_Main" API, has an execution time of (2 ms).

CPU Load for ECU 2 = ( 1 / 10 ) + ( 1 / 20 ) + ( 1 / 5 ) + ( 2 / 5 ) = 0.75 = 75 %
