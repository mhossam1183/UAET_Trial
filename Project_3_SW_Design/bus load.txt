Regarding CAN bus load calculation, assuming standard CAN frame consist of below field.

- Start-of-frame (1 bits): Denotes the start of frame transmission
- Identifier (11 bits): unique identifier, also represents message priority
- Remote transmission request (RTR) (1 bits): dominant (0) for data frames, and recessive (1) for request frames.
- Identifier extension bit (IDE) (1 bits): It indicates standard CAN frame is being transmitted with no extension.
- Reserved bit (r0) (1 bits): Must be dominant (0).
- Data length code (DLC) (4 bits):  Number of bytes of data (0â€“8 bytes)
- Data field (red) (0-64 bits): Data to be transmitted.
- CRC (15 bits): Cyclic redundancy check
- Bit stuffing is possible in some of the above fields around (18 bits) in the worst case.
- CRC delimiter (1 bits): Must be recessive (1)
- ACK slot (1 bits): Transmitter sends recessive (1) and any receiver can assert a dominant (0)
- ACK delimiter (1 bits): Must be recessive (1)
- End-of-frame (EOF) (7 bits): Must be recessive (1)
- Inter-frame spacing (IFS) (3 bits): Must be recessive (1)

So 1 CAN frame contains approximately 125 bit.

Assuming we are using 500 kBit/s bit rate.

bit time = 1 / bit rate = 1 / (500 * 1000) s = 0.002 ms

This means 1 bit will take 0.002 ms to transfer on bus when using 500 kBit/s.

So the time to transfer 1 frame carrying 125 bits is (0.002 ms/bit * 125 bit) = 0.25 ms.

WCET (worst case execution time) analysis:

utilization factor of one frame = transmission time * frequency = transmission time / Period

Door state message will be sent every 10ms.
Light switch state message will be sent every 20ms.
Speed state message will be sent every 5ms.
Assuming all 3 frames are identical i.e same transmission time (0.25 ms).

Bus Load = summation of utilization factor for all frames =
( 0.25 / 10 ) + ( 0.25 / 20 ) + ( 0.25 / 5 ) = 0.0875 = 8.75 %
